GA MERN Lab: Express on the back, React on the front. 

A lab for exploring building a full-stack MERN app

Get ready to build your first MERN app! For this lab, your goal is to build a
simple MERN app with Express on the back-end and React on the front-end. Your
app should have one and only one model!

## Prerequisites

- Mongo, Mongoose, Express and Node
- React, Components, State and Props
- React Component Lifecycle Methods
- React Router
- Single-server and Multi-server MERN apps

## Instructions

1.  Create new repo(s).
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.
1.  Post an issue on this repository with links to your repo(s).

Unlike most labs, for this one you submit your work by **posting an issue on
this repository, instead of forking this repository and making a pull request**.

Create a new repo or repos, depending on whether or not you're using the
single-server or multi-server pattern. Complete the requirements below and post
an issue on this repository linking to the relevant repo(s) under your GitHub
account. If you choose to make a single server repo, post one link; if you make
separate front and back ends, submit both links to the repo.

For this lab, you may pair up with one other person. Since we haven't yet
covered git workflows, you'll have to research the `git branch`, `git checkout`,
and `git merge` commands and how to use them together. The
[Atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) site is a
great starting point, particularly the
[Feature Branch Workflow Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).

## Requirements

Build a simple MERN app! Keep it very simple: only 1 model with full CRUD.

Your app should have a back-end build with Express that persists data to a
MongoDB database using Mongoose. Your Express app should return JSON data to
your React front-end.

The front-end for your simple MERN app should be built with React. Use AJAX to
get data from your Express back-end and pass the data through your app using
state and props. Use React Router to build out separate 'views' for creating,
editing, updating and deleting instances of your model.

Stick to just 1 model and keep it simple. The purpose of this lab is to practice
working with Express and React. Your goal should be to have full CRUD on one
model with a React front-end and Express back-end.

## Bonus

Add another model as a sub-document. Finish full CRUD on your first model before
adding a sub-document. Make it so users can perform full CRUD on the
sub-document.

## Double Bonus

Deploy your app. Use heroku for the backend and surge for the frontend.
